                    <p>KeeNok is a pop up focused on authentic dishes from Thailand as well as a few of our
                        favorites from
                        around the Asian continent. The idea sprang from our desperate search to find dishes from
                        Thailand
                        that just arenâ€™t currently available in Chicago. We determined the only way we could enjoy these
                        foods was to make them ourselves and so our journey began.
                        Through trial, error and a whole lot of
                        Thai cooking Youtube videos, we learned how to make some really tasty stuff. We started inviting
                        friends over to try our latest creations and that eventually lead to the birth of KeeNok.</p>
                    <p>
                        A little background on us: Bote grew up in Bangkok, eating some of the best food the country has
                        to
                        offer. She is the official taste tester of KeeNok and makes sure everything is aroy (delicious).
                        She
                        also has a degree in computer engineering. John is from Savannah Georgia and is beyond obsessed
                        with
                        food from every part of the world, especially Southeast Asia.
                    </p>
                    <p>KeeNok is hosted out of our small 2 bedroom apartment in Logan Square and seating is limited,
                        which
                        leads to a very communal dining experience. Our goal is to bring people together from all walks
                        of
                        life around unique, delicious food prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients, many of which we
                        grow
                        in our garden.</p>
                    <p>Once the  pandemic started, we decided to put a pause on pop ups for safety reasons. 
                        We still had a desire to share food with people though so we decided to start offering meals for pick up. 
                        Thus Keenok To Go was born. Check out the <span class='inline-link'> <a href="https://www.keenokthai.com/">website</a></span> Bote made where you can place your order and choose a pickup time. 
                        Let us know if you have any questions. Thanks & we look forward to hearing from you!</p>
